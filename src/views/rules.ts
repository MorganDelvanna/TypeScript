                                    <li>	Firearms owners must install a ‘Breech Plug (aka Clear Barrel Indicator or Chamber Flag) in the breech of every firearm, before removing a firearm(s) from a case.  The Breech Plug must remain in the firearm breech, during transport to and from the firing line, and/or to and from a temporary storage rack on the range, and if traveling between ranges</li>
                                    <li>	Breech Plugs may only be removed, and left out of a firearm, while the shooter is on the firing line and in direct control of their firearm, on a sanctioned range</li>
                                    <li>	Unattended firearms (those not in immediate use, or under direct personal control), must have an inserted breech plug, that is clearly visible, to other shooters and designated Range Officers, at all times</li>

                                        Competition Event Rules will take precedent over General

                                    <li>	Shooters may move closer to targets to shoot at lesser distances (if other shooters are absent, or if they are permitted to do so by other shooters present).  Shooters can NOT move targets to other, unsanctioned distances, from firing lines.  Note:  This point ties into the ‘target placement’ issue raised by Larry… it shall be referred to Rules Committee for further consideration</li>
                                    <li>	If more than two shooters are present, a Range Officer must be designated to supervise the Firing line and range operations</li>
